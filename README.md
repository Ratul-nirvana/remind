# Remind

Remind is a CLI based notification system where you can generate system alerts at any specified time in the future. Remind is intended to be used 
primarily as an alert service more like an alarm clock. The only difference from an alarm clock is that it doesnot scream and is developed for 
programmers who are too engrossed in their work to keep a track of time.
